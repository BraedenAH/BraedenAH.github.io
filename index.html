                    Mapping apps (Google, Apple Maps) are unreliable giving accurate ETAs for walking. Our solution is to create a more accurate algorithm to estimate that time.

                    My group and I worked together to create some ideas to further progress what we need about a walking app.

                    Together, my group and I made a persona each that we think would use our walking app.

                <p>
                    Myself and my group each made a storyboard using out personas to put them into a scenario where they would use our walking app.

                <p>
                    Each member of my group, including myself, created sketches of what we think our app would look like and how it would function of someone were to use it.
